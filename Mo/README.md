## SNAP potential for Mo

This directory contains various DFT data for fitting the Mo SNAP potential, including bulk structures with elastic deformation, surfaces, grain boundaries and DFT calculated molecular dynamics trajectories. We also include the test data of molecular dynamics trajectories of vacancy-containing structures. 

The hyperparameter tuning and fitting procedures are described in detail in our publication [1] and thus are excluded from the repo.
